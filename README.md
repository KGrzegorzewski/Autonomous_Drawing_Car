# Autonomous_Drawing_Car

The code was written for a self-writing robot, which was builded for Robohachaton - Bałtycka Bitwa Robotów 2020. 
The task to be performed in this competition was to make the inscription BRB2020 in any form. Me and my team decided to constructa robot which have marker mounted on a servo. The servo went up with the marker when the robot moved and rotated between the places where the inscription was to be made. The script has been written in Arduino language, based on C, C++ programming language.
